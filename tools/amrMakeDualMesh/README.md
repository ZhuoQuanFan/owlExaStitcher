# amrMakeDualMesh - A tool for computing a (unstructured) dual mesh for an AMR data set

This code was created by heavily borrowing code an ideas from
https://github.com/ingowald/cudaAmrIsoSurfaceExtraction ; which itself
is sample code for the paper

Ingo Wald, "A Simple, General, and GPU Friendly Method for Computing
Dual Mesh and Iso-Surfaces of Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) Data",
2020, ArXiv (number TBD).
